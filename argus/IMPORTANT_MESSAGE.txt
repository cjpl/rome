ARGUS is merged with ROME.
Please use romebuilder instead of argusbuilder.

There are three changes to make you project work.

(1) Replace <ArgusMonitorDefinition> tag in your definition file with <ROMEFrameworkDefinition>.

(2) Replace #include <???Monitor.h> with #include <???Analyzer.h> in your source code.

(3) Replace gMonitor with gAnalyzer in your code.
